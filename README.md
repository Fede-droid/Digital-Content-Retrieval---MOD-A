# Digital-Content-Retrieval - MOD A

## Color Gradient Generator

This MATLAB script generates a smooth color gradient by interpolating between specified colors. The user is prompted to input the desired number of colors, and the script creates a visual representation of the gradient.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fede-droid/Digital-Content-Retrieval---MOD-A.git
   cd PersonalProject
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository.
   - read the HELP with this command line: `help PersonalProject`.
   - Run the script `PersonalProject.m`.

3. **Enter the Number of Colors:**
   - The script will prompt you to enter the number of colors you want in the gradient.

4. **View the Result:**
   - The script will display a color gradient based on the specified number of colors.

### Code Explanation

The script initializes a matrix to store RGB values and defines six colors: red, green, blue, magenta, cyan, and white. It then uses linear interpolation to generate a smooth gradient between these colors.

### Example

```matlab
% Clear the command window and workspace
clc;
clear;

% ... (rest of the code)

% Show the result
imshow(rgbMatrix, 'InitialMagnification', 'fit');
```

## Important Note

- Ensure that you have MATLAB installed on your system.
- Adjust the script according to your specific requirements if needed.

Feel free to explore and modify the script to suit your projects or use it as a starting point for creating custom color gradients. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue in the repository.

Happy coding!
